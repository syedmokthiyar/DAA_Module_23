# EX 5D Minimum Jump to Reach End Array
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a python program for finding the minimum number of jumps needed to reach end of the array using Dynamic Programming.


## Algorithm
1. Create a jumps[] array of size n, initialized with infinity (inf), except jumps[0] = 0.

2. Loop through the array from index 1 to n-1.

3. For each i, check all previous indices j < i. If arr[j] + j >= i, update:
jumps[i] = min(jumps[i], jumps[j] + 1)

4. Return jumps[n-1] as the minimum number of jumps to reach the end.   

## Program:
Developed by: Syed Mokthiyar S M

Register Number:  212222230156

```python
def minJumps(arr, n):
    ##########  Add your code here ##############
    jumps = [0 for i in range(n)]
 
    if (n == 0) or (arr[0] == 0):
        return float('inf')
 
    jumps[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        jumps[i] = float('inf')
        for j in range(i):
            if (i <= j + arr[j]) and (jumps[j] != float('inf')):
                jumps[i] = min(jumps[i], jumps[j] + 1)
                break
    return jumps[n-1]

arr = []
n = int(input()) #len(arr)
for i in range(n):
    arr.append(int(input()))
print('Minimum number of jumps to reach','end is', minJumps(arr,n))
 

```

## Result:
Thus the program was executed successfully for finding the minimum number of jumps to reach end.
